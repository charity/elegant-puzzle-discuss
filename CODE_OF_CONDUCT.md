# Code of Conduct

## Short version

All subscribers, commenters, moderators and other participants are required to agree with the following code of conduct.  Moderators will enforce this code throughout the event.  We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## TL;DR

This list is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and supportive venue for inquiry and learning for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of other participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any workplace discussion except abstractly, in the context of management problems).  Participants violating these rules may be warned or unsubscribed without notice.

## Do these things:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Show empathy towards other members
* Ask questions.  Listen.  Ask for clarification.

## On Privacy

We follow the [Chatham House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) rules: do not speak of what you hear on this list outside of this list.  

Be mindful of the privacy of others who may not be aware you are sharing their stories here.  It is impossible to talk about your experiences without involving others' stories to some degree, so consider lightly anonymizing stories that others would feel uncomfortable about your sharing.  Use your judgment and try to do no harm.
