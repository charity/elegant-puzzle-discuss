=========

Welcome!  This is a book club and discussion group for ["An Elegant Puzzle"](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/), by [Will Larson](https://twitter.com/lethain), in summer 2019.  It is also an experiment in building temporary community.

## Purpose

The purpose of this group is to read ["An Elegant Puzzle"](https://lethain.com/elegant-puzzle/) with a group of our peers, and talk about any questions or challenges that come up for you while reading it.  Discussion need not be strictly limited to the text; personal stories or anecdotes or questions about engineering leadership or management are super encouraged..

This is not a permanent community.  There are plenty of those already.  The group is a **temporary participatory space** that will disperse once we are done reading and discussing the book, around the first week of August.

## Book club

Starting Sunday, June 16th, we will cover one chapter per week.  Every Sunday, I or another moderator will kick off an open thread with some thoughts on the next chapter.  

But please start new threads (or fork existing threads) at will.  All topics we've covered up until this point are fair game, but try not to drift too far into into upcoming chapter topics.

## Who should join?

* Engineers and technical practitioners (mostly senior folks)
* Managers of engineering or other technical teams
* Anyone interested in crafting career paths, building great teams, and developing their own leadership muscles

  <dd> Please do!  If you know someone who loves thinking and discussing these issues, give them this link.  Please don't post it to a broad public audience, e.g. your public twitter feed, but smaller forums where you know and vouch for the readership are fine (like a work list, or a private feed).</dd>
